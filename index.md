This course is an introduction to **computing** tools and **statistical** analyses used for **data science** in biological research.
The course aims to provide UC Merced students with an **integrative training** for analysing large datasets used in **ecological and evolutionay research**. Students will learn best practices for data science, open science principles and reproducibility, while building a skillset of analytical techniques such as structuring datasets, data management systems, programming for data wrangling and visualization, and interpretation of results.


_This course was adapted from the work of [Data Carpentry for Biologists](http://www.datacarpentry.org/semester-biology/), [Ecoinformatics](https://globalecologybiogeography.github.io/Ecoinformatics/), and [Data Management for Biologists](https://ericlind.github.io/data-mgmt-4-biologists/). It is designed as a flipped course for undergraduate students, and it can be useful for self-guided learners. Instructors are welcome to modify and use the material for their own courses. We encourage collaborative development and contributions by instructors and students, with the hopes that this will lead to better training and resources for everyone._
