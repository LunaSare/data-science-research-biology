      - According to the research paper, how much does data availability drop per year?
      - Contacted researchers say the data still exists, why is it considered lost?
      - What percentage of contacted researchers answered back?
      - How can authors organize and preserve data used in research papers?
      - Is willingness to share data increasing or decreasing among researchers?
