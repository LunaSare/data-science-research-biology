### Configure Git

Once Git is installed, you should configure your email and user name to track your version history.

1. Open up the Terminal or command line window (in Windows you can use Git bash)
2. Type and replace "Your name" and  your.email@domain.com from the following lines:

```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email your.email@domain.com
```
