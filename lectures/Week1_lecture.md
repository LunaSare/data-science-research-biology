> **Learning Objectives**
>
> This week, students will be able to:
>
> - list the elements of the data life cycle
> - articulate the relevance of good data management for scientific research
> - identify the differences between good and bad data entry and management
> - recognize bad data organization and why it is problematic for research
> - implement quality assurance and control measures for data entry in spreadsheets using excel
> - list current measures used by the scientific community in ecology and evolution to preserve data long term


### Welcome!

* Introductions
* Why are you taking this class?
* Introduce yourself to one of your neighbors you don't know

### Syllabus

* Go through the syllabus
* Do you have any questions about it?
* Choose grading scheme
* Choose office hours

#### Schedule

The schedule shows a list of topics that will be covered each week of the course.

The schedule reflects the flipped course structure, and organizes homework and in-class activities by topic:

* Homework
  - Prepare: Readings or activities to do before relevant class
  - Strengthen: Exercises to strengthen concepts discussed during class

* Lectures/live-coding
  - Lecture notes used in class
	- Not expected to be read in advance; may be useful for review
	- May not match lecture precisely

* In-class activities
  - Individually or jointly
  - A challenge that will support the construction of a mental model of your own
	- May require additional work time after class

### Lecture: Best practices for data entry and quality assurance using excel

**In-class discussion of reading for Day 1**
  - showcase data repository websites (GenBank, GBIF, Dryad, Zenodo)

**In-class discussion of readings for Day 2**
  - [In-class jamboard group activity](https://jamboard.google.com/d/1R2BrILLK9K6IPD6O7kBYrdao8-Sd5o82oPnbcGKeIQc/viewer?f=0).


**Live coding: Lesson [Quality Assurance and Control](http://www.datacarpentry.org/spreadsheet-ecology-lesson/04-quality-control)**
- What is the difference between quality assurance and quality control.
- Quality assurance
  - Demo data validation in excel using this data file [figshare.com/files/2252083](https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2252083). Students **download** it to their computer, too, and follow along.
- Quality control
  - Saving a copy of the original raw data is key.
  - Start a README file describing the documents you create in your project.
    - Use a template following readme best practices from https://data.research.cornell.edu/content/readme
  - Sorting to check for invalid data: [Exercise 1](https://datacarpentry.org/spreadsheet-ecology-lesson/04-quality-control/#exercise)
    - Ensure that data sorting is expanded to the whole data table, so data is not corrupted.
  - Conditional formatting to scan data for outliers: [Exercise 2](https://datacarpentry.org/spreadsheet-ecology-lesson/04-quality-control/#exercise-1)
    - Use this cautiously, it might corrput the data.

**In-class exercises**

- [Instructions]({{ site.baseurl}}/assignments/week1_activities/) and group activities.

**A minute feedback**
- Provide some quick feedback for this session [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeRETx27OK9PJlTd8djqySqrRa5ZMDTiUizF_vXuau82nASqQ/viewform).
