### Welcome!

* Introductions
* Why are you taking this class?
* Introduce yourself to one of your neighbors you don't know


### Course goals

* Data and how to work with it
* Data entry -> Data storage -> Data manipulation -> Data visualization
* Not statistics

### Teaching methods

* Flipped classroom
    * You don't learn how ride a bike just by listening to someone talk about it
      and the same is true for computing
* Homework before class: readings and exercises
* I do, we do, you do
    * I will demo an idea using live coding
  	* We will work on an associated exercise together in class
  	* Homework after class: You will work on additional exercises on your own (both in & out of class)
* Peer instruction
  * Interact with each other during the we do and you do parts
	* You are at least as likely to learn from your peers as from the instructor

### Course structure

* Homework
  - Preparation for class
  - Exercises to strengthen concepts discussed during class
* In-class activities
  - Individually or jointly
  - A challenge that will support student's construction of a mental model of their own
	- May require additional work time after class

* turn-in work
	* Ideally related to your research
