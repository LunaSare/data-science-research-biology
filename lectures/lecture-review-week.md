## Day 1: Making choices and loops - Review

### Review from last class (10 min)

- Apply and loops homework


### Setup your RStudio project (5 min)

- üéóÔ∏è Structuring your files into a _project_ is a best practice for good data science!
- Open your _RStudio project_ for the class; I called mine "**fall-2022**".
- Open a new file, name it "**choices-review.Rmd**", and save it to your "**documents**" folder.
