Project structure (30%)

- Organise your project files into different folders (i.e., data, outputs, figs, etc.)
- Name your folders and files in a consistent and informative way
- Avoid spaces, punctuation and accents in your files and folder names

Assignment submission (25%)

- All assignments should be submitted through Github or Github classroom.
- Commit and push any significant change of your project in Github so that we can see the whole assignment process

R code (25%)

- The code should be easy to read and understand.
- Separate the code into different sections (i.e., libraries, data, analysis, etc.)
- Include code and comments necessary to understand the assignment.

Reproducibility (20%)

- We should be able to reproduce the main outputs (i.e., tables, plots, summaries) without modifying anything from the code.
- Do not use setwd(), use Rproj files instead
- Make sure your code runs like you think it does
- Use relative paths, not absolute paths. E.g., use `data/mydata.csv` instead of `C:\Users\Batman\DataCarp\data\mydata.csv`.
- Make filenames in the code match the actual filenames
