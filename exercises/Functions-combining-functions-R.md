1. Write a function called `convert_kg_to_pounds` that converts kilograms into pounds (`pounds = 2.205 * kg`).
2. Use that function and your `get_mass_from_length()` function from [Default Arguments]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercises/Functions-default-arguments-R) to estimate the weight, in pounds, of a 12 m long Stegosaurus with `a = 10.95` and `b = 2.64` (The estimated `a` and `b` values for *Stegosauria* from [Seebacher 2001](http://www.jstor.org/stable/4524171)).
