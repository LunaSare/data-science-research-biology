1. Write a function called `convert_kg_to_pounds` that converts kilograms into pounds using the formula `pounds = 2.205 * kg`.
2. Use the function to calculate how many pounds is 50 kg.
3. Combine the function `convert_kg_to_pounds()` and your `get_mass_from_length()` function from the previous exercise to estimate the weight, in pounds, of a 12 m long Stegosaurus with `a = 10.95` and `b = 2.64` (The estimated `a` and `b` values for *Stegosauria* from [Seebacher 2001](http://www.jstor.org/stable/4524171)).
