1. Convert your conditional statement from the last exercise into a function called `get_y`, that takes
   `age_class` as an argument and returns `y`.

2. Call the function you just created 5 times, once with each of the following values for `age_class`, and print the values of `y`:   
  - "sapling",
  - "seedling",
  - "adult",
  - "mature",
  - "established".
