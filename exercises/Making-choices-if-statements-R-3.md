1. Copy the following code and complete the `if` statement so that if `age_class` is equal to
   "sapling" it sets `y <- 10` and if `age_class` is equal to "seedling" it
   sets `y <- 5` and if `age_class` is something else then it sets the value of
   `y <- 0`.
    ```r
    age_class = "adult"
    if (){

    }
    y
    ```

2. What is the value of `y`?
