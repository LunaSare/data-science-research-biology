1. Create the following variables:
    ```
    w <- 10.2
    x <- 1.3
    y <- 2.8
    z <- 17.5
    colors <- c("red", "blue", "green")
    masses <- c(45.2, 36.1, 27.8, 81.6, 42.4)
    dna1 <- "attattaggaccaca"
    dna2 <- "attattaggaacaca"
    ```

2. Use them to print whether or not the following statements are `TRUE` or `FALSE`.
  - a) `w` is greater than 10
  - b) `"green"` is in `colors`
  - c)`x` is greater than `y`
  - d)Each value in `masses` is greater than 40.
  - e)2 * `x` + 0.2 is equal to `y`
  - f)`dna1` is the same as `dna2`
  - g)`dna1` is not the same as `dna2`
  - h)`w` is greater than `x`, or `y` is greater than `z`
  - i)`x` times `w` is between 13.2 and 13.5
  - j) Each mass in `masses` is between 30 and 50.
