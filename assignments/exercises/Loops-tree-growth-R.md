If the file `TREE_SURVEYS.txt` isn't already in your working directory,
[download the data file here](https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/5629536).

1. Read the data in using the following code:

    ```r
    tree_data <- read.csv("https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/5629536",
                     sep = '\t',
                     na.strings = c("dead", "missing", "MISSING",
                                    "NA", "?", "3.3."))
    ```

1. Write a function named `get_growth()` that takes two inputs, a vector of `sizes` and a vector of `years`, and calculates the average annual growth rate. Pseudo-code for calculating this rate is `(size_in_last_year - size_in_first_year) / (last_year - first_year)`. Test this function by running `get_growth(c(40.2, 42.6, 46.0), c(2020, 2021, 2022))`.

2. Use dplyr and this function to get the growth for each individual tree along with information about the `TREATMENT` that tree occurs on. Trees are identified by a unique value in the `ORIGINAL_TAG` column. Don't include information for cases where a `TREATMENT` is not known (e.g., where it is `NA`).

3. Using ggplot the output from (2) make a histogram of growth rates for each `TREATMENT`, which each `TREATMENT` in it's own facet. Use `geom_vline()` to add a vertical line at 0 to help indicate which trees are getting bigger vs. smaller. Include good axis labels.

4. Create a single function called `compare_growth()` that combines your work in (2) and (3). It should take the arguments:`df` (the data frame being used), `measure` (the column that contains the size measurement to measure growth on; we used `CIRC`), `tag_column` (the name of the column with the unique tag; we used `ORIGINAL_TAG`), `sample_column` (the name of the column indicating different samples, we used `YEAR`), and `facet_column` (the name of the column to use to determine which groups to make histograms for, we used `TREATMENT`). Use the function to recreate your original plot using `compare_growth(tree_data, CIRC, ORIGINAL_TAG, YEAR, TREATMENT)`. Then use the function to create a similar plot showing growth faceted `SPECIES`, using `SURVEY` as the `sample_column`, and `AXIS_1` as the `measure` by running `compare_growth(tree_data, AXIS_1, ORIGINAL_TAG, SURVEY, SPECIES)`.
