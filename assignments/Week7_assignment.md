## Reproducible documents assignment

{% include assignment.html %}

Using the [amniote life-history database](http://www.esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E096/269/#data),

1. State a question that explore the effect of body size on lifestyle and productivity in amniotes (in any group and at any level)
2. Create a reproducible document in your favorite format (.pdf, .html or .md) that includes
 * Download and read data
 * Data exploration and visualisation
 * Relationship between variables
 * Distribution of values of a specific variable among different groups
3. Select two species of reptiles and download occurrence dataset from GBIF
4. Extract values of Annual mean temperature and Precipitation for each species
5. Plot the occurrences of both species on a map
6. Compare the temperature and precipitation value distribution of both species using histograms or boxplots
